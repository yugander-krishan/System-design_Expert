- When thinking on db's think about the type of schema you require. That will decide what kind of databases you can use like sql or no-sql. Then you can use master-slave or multi-master techniques on sql and nosqls like cassandra are KV and scalable and distributed or mongo db is document based.

- In databses for scaling master-slave architecture we can use sharding.

- When thinking about servers you want to use different concepts like distributed using consistent hashing or using sharded for handling different requests.
